# Parallel-ML-Stress-Classification
In this project, we will use various machine learning classification models, MPI for parallelization, and data from the WESAD dataset to classify stress data into states of baseline, stress, or amusement. We will then compare the accuracy and speed-ups between each of the ML models and parallelization windows.
